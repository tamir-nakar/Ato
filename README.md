# ATO: AI Tab Organizer

## Overview

Welcome to ATO, your AI-powered Tab Organizer! ATO intelligently manages and sorts your browser tabs, enhancing your browsing experience and improving your productivity. With ATO, you can effortlessly keep your tabs organized, ensuring you always find what you need when you need it.

## Features

### Two Ways to Use ATO

1. **By Demand**: With just a single click, you can organize all of your open tabs. This option is perfect for users who want a quick and easy way to declutter their workspace.

2. **Dynamically (On the Fly)**: Every time you open a new tab, ATO will automatically organize it the moment it’s created. This ensures that your tab management is always up to date without any extra effort on your part.

### Three Methods of Organization

ATO offers three intelligent methods to organize your tabs:

1. **By Category**: ATO categorizes your tabs by analyzing the essence of each one, using tab properties to determine its semantic domain and assign it to a category. This helps you quickly find related tabs based on their themes or topics.

2. **By Last Access**: This method organizes your tabs based on when you last accessed them. ATO groups your tabs into reasonable time frames, allowing you to easily revisit recently used tabs while keeping older ones accessible without cluttering your workspace.

3. **By Frequency (Prediction)**: ATO predicts which tabs you are most likely to access next based on your past behavior. By analyzing how often you’ve opened each tab, it sorts them in an order that prioritizes the most frequently accessed tabs, making your browsing experience smoother and more efficient.
